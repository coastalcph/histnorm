# German normalization dataset

## RIDGES

This dataset comes from Version 5.0 of the [RIDGES (Register in Diachronic
German Science)
project](https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en/institut-en/professuren-en/korpuslinguistik/research/ridges-projekt).

The two-column normalization dataset was prepared by Uwe Springmann, Bryan
Jurish, and Martin Klotz.  It is comprised of 16 texts from the corpus
originating between 1482 and 1652; newer texts were deliberately included as
they tend to show significantly less variation.  For each text, a random
70/15/15 split of sentences was performed to create the final train/dev/test
splits.


## Anselm

This dataset has not been made public so far.

We are in the process of obtaining permission to redistribute the Anselm dataset
and are hopeful that we can include it for the final version.
